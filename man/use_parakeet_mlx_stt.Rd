\usage{
use_parakeet_mlx_stt(
  audio_file,
  initial_prompt = "",
  language = NULL,
  hf_model_name = "mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{audio_file}{The path to the audio file to transcribe.}

\item{initial_prompt}{This parameter is accepted for API consistency with
other STT functions but is currently ignored as \code{parakeet-mlx} CLI does not
support an initial prompt via its command-line arguments. Defaults to \code{""}.}

\item{language}{This parameter is accepted for API consistency with other STT
functions but is currently ignored as \code{parakeet-mlx} CLI typically
auto-detects language or relies on model-specific capabilities.}

\item{hf_model_name}{The Hugging Face repository name of the Parakeet model
to use with the CLI's \code{--model} option. Defaults to
\code{"mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, currently ignored by this function, but
accepted for API consistency when called from \code{perform_speech_to_text}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the full transcribed text (\code{text}) and a list of
transcription segments (\code{segments}), where each segment has an \code{id},
\code{start} time, \code{end} time, and \code{text}.
}
\description{
This function uses the \code{parakeet-mlx} command-line tool to transcribe audio.
It assumes \code{parakeet-mlx} is installed and accessible in the system's PATH.
\code{parakeet-mlx} is an implementation of Nvidia's Parakeet ASR models using
MLX. This function also requires \code{ffmpeg} to be installed for audio
processing by \code{parakeet-mlx}. See https://github.com/senstella/parakeet-mlx
for CLI installation and usage.
