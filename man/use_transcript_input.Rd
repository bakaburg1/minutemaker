\description{
This function takes an external transcript file (VTT, SRT, or DOCX),
standardizes it into the internal format used by the package, and saves it
as a JSON file in the transcription output directory. This allows the rest
of the workflow to proceed as if the transcript was generated by the
package's speech-to-text models.
