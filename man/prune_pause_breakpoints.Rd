\title{Prune Breakpoints Near Pauses}
\usage{
prune_pause_breakpoints(breakpoints, pauses, pause_duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{breakpoints}{A numeric vector of candidate breakpoints (e.g., segment
start or end times in seconds).}

\item{pauses}{A numeric vector indicating the locations of pauses (in the
same units as breakpoints).}

\item{pause_duration}{A numeric value specifying the minimum allowed distance
(in the same units as breakpoints) between a pause and a breakpoint, or
between consecutive breakpoints near a pause, for a breakpoint to be kept.}
}
\value{
The pruned vector of breakpoints, with those too close to pauses
removed.
}
\description{
This function removes breakpoints from a numeric vector that are too close to
specified pauses. Specifically, it ensures that any breakpoint which is
either the first or last in the sequence, or is within \code{pause_duration}
units of a pause, is removed. This helps to guard against stale indices and
unwanted breaks near areas of silence in transcript segmentation or
windowing.

breakpoints <- c(0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500)
pauses <- c(200, 400)
