apply_single_correction_set(text, corr_map)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A character string to which corrections will be applied.}

\item{corr_map}{A named list where names are incorrect terms and values are
their corrections.}
}
\value{
The corrected text string with all replacements applied.

\description{
This helper function applies a map of corrections to a text string. It sorts
the correction keys by length in descending order to prevent shorter incorrect
terms from disrupting longer ones during replacement.

text <- "This is a smple text with misspellings"
corrections <- list("smple" = "simple", "misspellings" = "misspellings")
apply_single_correction_set(text, corrections)
