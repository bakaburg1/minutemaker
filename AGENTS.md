# Agent Rules

For any requested change or task which is not trivial, you should always assess the situation, make tests and then present a detailed plan of action before ANY change to the code.
You'll enact your plan of action after the plan has been approved by the user.

**Exception:** The planning and wait for approval process is not needed when asked to add documentation.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: When In Doubt, Ask First

Do not blindly interpret and enact changes if:

- The requirements or desiderata are not clear.
- There are two or more drastically different approaches to solve an issue.
- Some evidence you found would lead you to take bold or significant choices.
- You noticed something else that seems to be wrong or not working as expected while trying to perform a requested task.

**Always ask to confirm the course of action before proceeding.** When in doubt, ask.
