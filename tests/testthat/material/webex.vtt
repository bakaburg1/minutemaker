1 "VOICE-A17" (9017000001)
00:00:00.649 -->; 00:00:03.210
Can everyone hear me?

2 "NODE-03" (9003000002)
00:00:03.210 -->; 00:00:10.600
Yes. Loud and clear.
The display is still loading on my side.

3 "CALLER-X" (9000000123)
00:00:10.600 -->; 00:00:10.950
Yeah.

4 "VOICE-B04" (9004000004)
00:00:10.950 -->; 00:00:33.800
Quick recap: the slipstream test produced a harmonic pattern at 13, 21, and 34 kilohertz, and the navigation solver remapped coordinates during the same 2.3 seconds. We confirmed it's in the raw stream, not the UI.

5 "VOICE-A17" (9017000001)
00:00:33.800 -->; 00:00:36.500
[laughter]

6 "NODE-03" (9003000002)
00:00:36.500 -->; 00:00:40.200
[inaudible]

7 "VOICE-C99" (9099000007)
00:00:40.200 -->; 00:00:50.900
The console shows "SAFE MODE" but the log includes & flags a checksum mismatch.

8 "VOICE-D12" (9012000008)
00:00:50.900 -->; 00:01:01.300
I will share my screen now.

9 "VOICE-D12-RENAMED" (9012000008)
00:01:01.300 -->; 00:01:06.700
Can you see the slide deck?

10 "UNKNOWN-PORT" (9077000010)
00:01:06.700 -->; 00:01:10.900
No, not yet.

11 "VOICE-E21" (9021000011)
00:01:10.900 -->; 00:01:16.500
I see it now, it just appeared.

12 "VOICE-F08" (9008000012)
00:01:15.900 -->; 00:01:22.000
Yes, same here. It's visible in presenter mode.

13 "NODE-07" (9007000013)
00:01:22.000 -->; 00:01:24.300

14 "VOICE-G33" (9033000014)
00:01:24.300 -->; 00:01:44.900
So, the star-map kind of rewrote itself and. we saw drift then it snapped back, NO error bars around it, but these are large numbers, so it's likely quite accurate.
